      "answer": "D) Physical stress such as scratching or rubbing",
      "explanation": "While multinucleation can have several causes, in the context of stratified squamous epithelium without significant cellular atypia as seen in the image, multinucleation is often a response to physical stress such as scratching or rubbing. Viral infections can lead to multinucleation due to syncytia formation, ultraviolet radiation could cause various alterations including atypia or cancerous changes, and chemical-induced transformation would also lead to significant cellular atypia, which are not typical features described in the image.",

      "answer": "B) Fibrosis",
      "explanation": "Fibrosis, characterized by the proliferation of fibrous connective tissue, is commonly an aftermath of chronic inflammatory processes, supporting the presence of an inflammatory process rather than a neoplastic one. Necrosis can occur in both inflammatory and neoplastic processes. Angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels, is often seen in neoplastic processes to supply nutrients to rapidly growing tumors. Edema is a general feature of inflammation but is not as specific as fibrosis for a chronic and possibly resolving inflammatory condition.",

      "answer": "B) Deposition of mineral crystals",
      "explanation": "The elongated pink-staining structures resemble crystals and have an exogenous appearance, suggesting they are foreign material deposited within the tissue rather than typical cellular elements. The lack of features typical for blood vessels, smooth muscle, or nerve fibers, as well as the additional context of the patient's occupational exposure, supports the identification as mineral crystal deposits, specifically uranyl nitrate crystals due to uranium mine exposure. Therefore, option B is the correct answer.",
